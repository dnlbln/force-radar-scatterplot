- Having a lessons learned txt file in each project. (like a readme)
    -> great idea, think about a blogpost.

- Create a function fillWithRandomData that accepts counts
    - have some preset configs per data element
    - pick random presets untill the count is reached and create the raw config object for data
    - pass it to setData()
        - do an integrity check and throw errors so users know what is missing
        - if it passes the integiry check parse the data and create classes/internal objects

in this construction you have a random data generator that can generator random amounts of data
you can test out your integiry check and setData function.

Also your users can quickly visualise the chart and see how it will look and use it without havin to supply data.
great for testing






- There is a general structure to building every visualisations.
    - Having a template can save a lot of time.

- Mistakes:
    - thinking too generic instead of building it for the type of job
    - a lot of constant refactoring - I call it ping-ponging
        - I guess this gets better with experience
