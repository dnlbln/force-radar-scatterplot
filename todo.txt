Major:
-------
- Changing colours:
    - Must loop over points and create node manually and set it in the point.

- Updating the count in the center depending on the points.

- Highlighting a point/points

Medium:
-------

- Discuss where and how to show statistics for the other targets.

Minor:
-------
    - prefix non d3 vars in the point class so we can see the difference.

    - figuring out how to reset the position of a point if it goes out of bounds
        - Tried it and the points just flies all over the place.
