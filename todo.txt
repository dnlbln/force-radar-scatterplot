Major:
-------

- Font size is not being correctly applied to target elements and their statistics counterparts.

Medium:
-------

- Showing tooltips for points.

- Grey out the statistics at the targets in the beginning?

Minor:
-------
    - prefix non d3 vars in the point class so we can see the difference.

    - figuring out how to reset the position of a point if it goes out of bounds
        - Tried it and the points just flies all over the place.
